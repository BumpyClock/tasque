# LEARNINGS

- 2026-02-17: Chose JSONL-first V1 architecture (`.tasque/events.jsonl` source of truth, `state.json` derived cache). Explicitly no sqlite/dolt/backend abstraction in V1.
- 2026-02-17: Beads-inspired plan finalized in `docs/learned/tasque-v1-implementation-plan.md`. Chosen path: Bun+TypeScript V1, JSONL source-of-truth + derived state cache + single-machine lockfile protocol for <=5 concurrent agents.
- 2026-02-17: Locked V1 defaults: Bun runtime; fixed 6-char hash IDs + append-only child IDs; strict CAS claim; no generic link API in V1; supersede without auto-rewire; dep/supersede cycle rejection; state cache gitignored; JSON output includes schema_version=1.
- 2026-02-17: Updated V1 spec to Beads-compatible supersede/link behavior: generic `link add/remove` in V1; `supersede` closes source task and sets `superseded_by` without dependency rewiring.
- 2026-02-17: Locked durability decisions: bidirectional relates_to, canonical supersede command (close source + superseded_by), universal JSON envelope with schema_version=1, ULID event IDs, fail-safe stale-lock cleanup, and snapshot-based compaction with events.jsonl as canonical source.
- 2026-02-17: Docs synced to shipped V1 behavior (including `doctor`, `--exact-id`, lock policy, JSON envelope, and storage layout). Pitfall fixed: plan/spec references diverged from implementation defaults (`snapshot_every=200`, local-only snapshots via `.tasque/.gitignore`).
- 2026-02-17: Corrected earlier draft mismatch: V1 does include generic `link add/remove` plus dedicated `supersede` workflow command.
- 2026-02-17: Added release packaging flow: `bun run build` compiles single binary; `bun run release` emits platform artifact + `SHA256SUMS.txt` in `dist/releases/`.
- 2026-02-17: Added skill lifecycle via `tsq init` for `claude|codex|copilot|opencode` with safe managed-marker semantics (`install`, `uninstall`, idempotent update, non-managed skip unless force) plus CLI/e2e coverage.
- 2026-02-17: Added `tsq list --tree` with nested parent/child rendering and per-node blocker/dependent context; JSON mode returns structured `tree` nodes (`task`, `blockers`, `dependents`, `children`).
- 2026-02-17: Renamed derived cache path from `.tasque/state.json` to `.tasque/tasks.jsonl`; dropped legacy cache-file read compatibility.
- 2026-02-17: Polished `tsq list --tree` output with width-aware density modes (wide/medium/narrow): inline metadata on wide terminals, dependency flow on secondary line for medium, and truncated titles + metadata lanes on narrow widths; covered by dedicated renderer width-tier tests.
- 2026-02-17: Implemented Beads-parity features: `close`/`reopen` (multi-id), `history` (filtered, newest-first, limit+truncation), `label add/remove/list` + `list --label`, `dep tree` (up/down/both with cycle-safe visited set), `search` (structured query with field:value, negation, AND logic). All via existing `task.updated` event type — no schema changes. Pitfall: `resolveTaskId` throws `TASK_NOT_FOUND` not `NOT_FOUND`; negated search queries (`-field:value`) need `--` separator due to commander option parsing.
- 2026-02-17: Snapshot maintenance hardened: loader now scans newest-to-oldest valid snapshot and reports warnings for invalid files; snapshot writes prune to latest 5 files with repair command as backstop.
- 2026-02-18: Implemented external release hooks (no tsq release command): `bun run release` now generates task-derived `RELEASE_NOTES.md/.json` from installed `tsq --json`, uses latest git tag baseline when present, and writes SHA256 over all release artifacts.
- 2026-02-18: Beads gap review captured in `docs/learned/beads-gap-analysis-2026-02-18.md`. Recommended next pull-overs for Tasque: rich task content (`description` + notes), `stale` command, selected list filter expansion, then duplicate workflow and optional external refs; explicitly skip Dolt/daemon/sync class features for current single-user local-first scope.
- 2026-02-18: Added rich content core: optional task `description`, append-only deterministic `notes` (from `task.noted` event metadata), CLI note commands, update/create description flags, show rendering visibility, and search matching across title+description+notes.
